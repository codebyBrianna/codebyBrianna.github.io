        <h2> Art</h2>
        
            <h3>Intro</h3>
                <p>Something that I am very passionate about is art. Yes art as in drawing and painting, but also art as in
                    music or liturature. Art can be found in so many different and wonderful ways. I like to explore and see 
                    these many ways because they inspire me.
                </p>
            <h3>Music</h3>
                <p>I love music. It's not just one song that I really like to listen to every once in a while. I love music. 
                    From small melodies on a piano or small strums on a ukelele to bands that some people have never even
                    heard of, to musicals that are just too darn catchy. I almost always have earphones with me because I know
                    I'll listen to music soon. I listen to music so often. If we can listen to music in class, you know I'll
                    get my earphones out. I listen to music while doing homework, on car rides, and while playing games. No 
                    matter what, I always have a song (or entire albums/musicals or two) stuck in my head.</p>
        
            <h3>Books</h3>
                <p>I'd like to thank every author in the world for books. Books are just so awesome. Imagine, creating an entire
                    new universe in your own head, with your own made up characters and events. Then putting it on paper for 
                    everyone else to see. Imagine. Entire new worlds to become a part of. New friends, new adventures, and most 
                    importantly, an escape. Whether it's stress or just plain procrastination, books can take you in and get you lost
                    in their world of ink. And I don't intend to find my way back.</p>
        
            <h3>Art</h3>
                <p>And finally, what I named this title after. Art. As I said in my hobbies I like to draw.</p>
