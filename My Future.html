        <h2> My Future Plans</h2>
            <h3> High School</h3>
                <p>Sato: I would like to go to Sato High School because they have medical pathways. 
                I have been interested in the medical field for a while so it would be nice to join Sato for this. <br>
                 McBride: I also want to go the McBride High School. McBride, like Sato, has a medical pathway.
                McBride is kind of near my home, so it would be easy to get there. <br>
                Lakewood high school: Lakewood High school does not have medical pathways, however they do have Merit Scholars. 
                The Merit Scholars is a program in which you can take accelerated classes and it will
                look good in college applications.      
                </p>
            <h3>College</h3>
                <p>
                     I have not had the granted time to think of which college would be of my wanting yet.
                    I do know that UCLA is a very good college and I think that it would be a really good college to go to.
                </p>
            <h3>Career Interests</h3>
                <p>
                Ever since my elementary years I have dreamed of becoming a surgeon or a doctor. 
                I always wanted to be able to help people and save lives. 
                </p>
            <h3>Goals</h3>
                <p>
                 I don’t really have a lot of goals. My main goal is to live a good life as an adult.
                    Of course this goal is made up of a bunch of other tiny goals. Like get through high school,
                    then college and to thrive as a surgeon or whatever my future job will be, hopefully, it’s a surgeon.
                    Besides this I also have another goal of meeting my idols, the sources of my inspiration,
                    though this is more like a dream. Hopefully one day my goals will be achieved.
                    <br>
