        <h2> My Future Plans</h2>
            <h3> High School</h3>
                <p>Sato: I would like to go to Sato High School because they have medical pathways. 
                I have been interested in the medical field for a while so it would be nice to join Sato for this. 
                 McBride: I also want to go the McBride High School. McBride, like Sato, has a medical pathway.
                McBride is kind of near my home, so it would be easy to get there. Lakewood high school: Lakewood 
                High school does not have medical pathways, however they do have Merit Scholars. 
                The Merit Scholars is a program in which you can take accelerated classes and it will
                look good in college applications.
