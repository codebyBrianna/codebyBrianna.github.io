        <h2>All About ATM</h2>
            <h3>About ATM</h3>
                <p>ATM is a three year computer program at Bancroft Middle School.
                 In this program, students are taught how to use the many programs 
                 and wonders of the internet and other devices.</p>
            <h3> 6th Grade Learning</h3>
                <p>In 6th grade, my first year of ATM, we were introduced to Microsoft Word, 
                how to type well and fast and different ways to be safe on the web.
                Typing: I was taught how to type, then to progress into typing fast.
                Microsoft Word: I learned how to make documents and cool tricks I could 
                use when in high school. Web safety: I was introduced into the many different
                 ways to stay safe on the internet.<br>

            <h3>7th Grade Learning</h3>
                <p>My 7th gradeyear was the second of my three ATM years. I was taught,
                 how to use SketchUp, FloorPlanner and also how to use photoshop. SketchUp: 
                 I learned to design multiple buildings. FloorPlanner: I learned to take measurements,
                  then apply it into designing rooms. Photoshop: I made travel card from Paris, using 
                  this, I learned many things here.

            <h3>8th Grade Learning</h3>
                <p>In my last of my 3 years of ATM, my 8th grade year, I was learned how to code.
                I used programs such as Khan Acadamy and Dash to help me with it. I made my own
                website in Dash, and a blog too.<br>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>
                Altogether, the ATM program was very helpful to me. I got to learn about new programs 
                and how to use them. I also got to be able to type faster than I originally did. 
                I know how to code as well which could be useful in the future. 
                Because of ATM I know how to use helpful things I may use in the future. 
                Such as in high school I could use a powerpoint, or a document easily unlike non-ATM students would. 
                The ATM program is very beneficial for me.
