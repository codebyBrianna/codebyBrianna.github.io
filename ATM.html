        <h2>All About ATM</h2>
            <h3>About ATM</h3>
                <p>ATM is a three year computer program at Bancroft Middle School.
                 In this program, students are taught how to use many programs and 
                 wonders of the internet. Learn more about it <a target="_blank" href="http://lbbancroft.schoolloop.com/atm">here.</a>

            <h3> 6th Grade Learning</h3>
                <p>In 6th grade, my first year of ATM, we were introduced to Microsoft Word, 
                how to type well and fast and different ways to be safe on the web.<br>
                Typing: I was taught how to type, then to progress into typing fast.<br>
                Microsoft Word: I learned how to make documents and cool tricks I could 
                use when in high school.<br> 
                Web safety: I was introduced into the many different ways to stay safe on the internet.

            <h3>7th Grade Learning</h3>
                <p>My 7th grade year was the second of my three ATM years. I was taught,
                 how to use SketchUp, FloorPlanner and also how to use photoshop.<br> SketchUp: 
                 I learned to design multiple buildings.<br> FloorPlanner: I learned to take measurements,
                  then apply it into designing rooms.<br> Photoshop: I made travel card from Paris! Being
                  a part of the ATM program helped me learn a lot about it.

            <h3>8th Grade Learning</h3>
                <p>In my last of my 3 years of ATM, my 8th grade year, I learned how to code. 
                    (I'm using my skills to make this very website!)
                I used programs such as Khan Acadamy and Dash to help me with it. I made my own
                website in Dash, and a blog too. Wanna See?

                   Later this year, I learned how to film. I learned the many film shots and how to use iMovie. Despite
                    learning the many film shots, I decided to make an animation because I like to draw. Because of the dangers of
                    global warming (and a project we did in class,) that's what I did <a target= “_blank” href= “https://youtu.be/1IGIfwHKJLQ" the video </a> about.

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>
                Altogether, the ATM program was very helpful to me. I got to learn about new programs 
                and how to use them. I also got to be able to type faster than I originally did. 
                I know how to code as well which could be useful in the future. 
                Because of ATM I know how to use helpful things I may use in the future. 
                Such as in high school I could use a powerpoint, or a document easily unlike non-ATM students would. 
                The ATM program is very beneficial for me.
