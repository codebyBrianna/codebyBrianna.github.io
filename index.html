        <h2> About Brianna</h2>
            <h3> Skills</h3>
                <p>I have good grades in school, my GPA has never dropped below a 3.5. 
                    I am currently learning piano and I’ve been told my drawings are really good. <br>

            <h3> Hobbies</h3>
                <p>My hobbies include reading, drawing and playing piano. 
                    I having multiple shelves full of books and I doubt I can choose a favorite
                    but I will always enjoy John Green’s books. I like to draw things, from objects in my room
                     to original characters of my imagination. I also enjoy making melodies on my keyboard.<br>

            <h3>Interests</h3>
                <p>I have multiple interests, but my favorite will always be listening to music.
                     I love music from bands to musicals, I even sometimes like to imagine I could 
                     create a musical of my own. I also really like watching shows and youtube. 
                     I know, it seems lazy, but they give me lots of inspiration and an escape from reality when I need it.<br>
